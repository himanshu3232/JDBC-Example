**# Welcome to my CodSoft Internship Projects! **

This repository houses my exciting journey through the CodSoft internship program, where I'll be tackling diverse projects to enhance my coding skills and earn the internship certificate.

Here's a sneak peek at the projects I'll be working on:

1. Number Guessing Game: A classic game with a twist, challenging players to guess a secret number within a range.
2. Grade Calculator: A tool to simplify grade calculations.
3. ATM Interface: A simulated ATM experience, allowing users to interact with a virtual bank account for withdrawals, deposits, and balance checks.
4. Currency Converter: An efficient way to convert between different currencies using an API.
5. Student Management System: A comprehensive system to manage student records.
   
Stay tuned for project updates and demos as I progress through each one!

While I'm primarily focusing on independent development, I'm open to feedback and suggestions. Feel free to create issues or pull requests if you have valuable insights to share.
